#  EL-9123: Introduction to Machine Learning
Some notes, assignments, labs while taking the course.

# Statement
* Labs are completed independently, as the assighment of ML class.
* Demos are created by the professor, I just do it again and add some personal comments to help me better understand while reviewing.

## Study Notes
* Sort of in mess...
* Will collate them progressively！
## Homework and Solutions
* Just personal solutions: not guarantee correctness :)
* Original questions and solutions are in different files
